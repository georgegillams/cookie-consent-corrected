This is the code for the website only. Other repos will be created for the proposal itself and any proof-of-concept tooling we build!

This project uses React with Server-side rendering (SSR). We may hook it up with a database and Redux at some point ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

## Running locally
To run this, ensure that `node` (preferably `v8.11.4`) is installed, and then run `npm i && npm run dev`

Note that a post-install script is used to transpile some dependencies. It will therefore take longer the first time it executes.

`npm run dev` will set all necessary environment variables needed to run the application.
